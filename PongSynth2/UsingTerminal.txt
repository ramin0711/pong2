Using Terminal (or Command Prompt for Windows)
by Perry R. Cook, October 2015

For much of the code used in this course, you can work in
miniAudicle (ChucK’s Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) and editor).  But for the PONG animation+sound code, 

You should run these programs in a Terminal shell window
(Mac, LINUX) or Command Prompt (DOS box) Window.  

On a Mac, the Terminal lives in 
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app

On Linux, Under System Tools or Accessories, you should
find a program called Terminal.  There might be many 
different types of shells and terminals,  If you're a 
Linux-type, you very likely already have your favorite.

On Windows, find and run Start/AllPrograms/Accessories,
Command Prompt.  Or, use find (Search this PC) to 
locate and launch Command.com or Command Prompt.
Windows 8:  Swipe up to Apps screen, search for 
Command, pick one Command Prompt (mostly shortcuts,
any is probably fine) and launch it.

Anyway, somehow create a Terminal/Prompt, then type 
(on Mac or Linux):

ls 

followed by a carriage return (ls means "list")

or in Windows, type:

dir

with carriage return (dir means "directory")

This lists all the files that terminal can see right now.

Now type:

cd ..

which takes you up one level in the directory structure

cd FolderName 

takes you into the folder/directory named FolderName

You can execute files from the Terminal, and do much
more, like rename, move, etc.

More Terminal/Command Prompt commands:

<ctrl>-c   (that means pressing and holding the Control key,
and adding the "c" key so they're both held down at the same time)

Control-c is your friend, because it stops any program that
that you started/ran from the Terminal.  Many ChucK demos 
are infinite loops, so you'll use <ctrl>-c to stop them
when you're tired of it.

Command:			what it does:

cd ..				go up one directory level 
cd ../..			go up two directory levels
ls -l				long listing (Mac/Linux file size, dates, etc)
dir 				long listing (Windows)
cp filename1 filename2		copy (duplicate) filename1 to filename2
rm filename			remove/delete file (Mac/Linux  BE CAREFUL!!!)
del filename			remove/delete file (Windows    BE CAREFUL!!!)
mv filename filename/path	move or rename arg1 to arg2 (Mac/Linux)
move filename filename/path	move arg1 to arg2 (Windows)
pwd				print current directory (Mac/Linux)
more filename			show contents of text file, example:

	more PONG 

	displays:

	chuck PongPhysics1.ck | ./PongViewGL

<anycommand>/?			Windows only, adding /? lists all options

man <anycommand>		Mac/Linux, man means “manual”, prints description
